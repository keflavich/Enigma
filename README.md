Enigma
======

An automatic data analyzer using a slew of methods to generate a report for the user. If the data is photometry, then automatically grab multi-wavelength images on the region and overplot the photometry data. Analyze data for correlations, clustering, and anomalies. Once a framework has been created, Enigma will be expanded to analyze other data types, like spectra and image files. The purpose of Enigma is provide an easily obtainable first look at a dataset and then explore the interesting components
