Enigma
======

Enigna is an automatic data analyzer using a slew of methods to generate a report for the user. If the data is photometry, then it will (1) automatically grab multi-wavelength images on the region and overplot the photometry data and (2) analyze data for correlations, clustering, and anomalies. Once a framework has been created, Enigma will be expanded to analyze other data types, like spectra and image files. The purpose of Enigma is to provide an easily obtainable first look at a dataset and then explore the interesting components. This is a product of .Astronomy's hack-ideas.
